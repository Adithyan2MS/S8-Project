\par In particular, phishing has become more common and
has begun to raise significant issues. There needs to design phishing 
 detection method to affectively detect if the website is phishing or non-phishing. Considering the significance of phishing detection,
in this study, we extracted 74 different features from the website URL. After comparing different machine learning algorithms, we found that Logistic Regression gives higher accuracy. So we used Logistic Regression model for phishing prediction. In future we are planning to design a
framework for identifying and preventing phishing attacks that are delivered through email messages.
