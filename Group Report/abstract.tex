\hspace{1cm}Phishing is a type of cyberattack that aims to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent in todayâ€™s digital world. Thus, The development of the phishing detection model is essential to combat the increasing threat of phishing attacks, protect users from fraud and data breaches, and enhance overall cybersecurity in the digital landscape. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to detect phishing websites by analyzing various features. In this research paper, we compare several machine learning algorithms to detect phishing websites using a dataset of 545,895 samples which is created by pre-processing and merging two separate datasets. We use 74 features to train and evaluate the algorithms, and we found that Logistic Regression (LR) achieved the highest accuracy of 94.44\% after comparing models. The trained LR model is integrated into our WhalingGuard. Web Application for predicting whether the input URL from the user interface is phishing or non-phishing.
